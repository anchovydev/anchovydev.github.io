## hi, this is my website!

i'm anchovy, and this is my (horrible) website i created. to view the source code, click [here](https://github.com/anchovydev/anchovydev.github.io).

## what am i using this for?

nothing much, really. this is just a random website i update when i remember to.

## why so formal?

this is my only semi-formal page because it's linked to my github repository.
