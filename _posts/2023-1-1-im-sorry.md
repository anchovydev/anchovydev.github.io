# i'm sorry...

for not posting in a year! get it? it's cuz it's the new year.

i didn't stay up for the ball drop. i was like a bicycle - two tired. ok, i'll stop with the bad jokes (not really).

## tug team

i was with my bestie arnev. kevin spelled arnevorz wrong somehow. anchovy not happy about that. we were "jenny toll's team". those goofy ahhs didn't realize what it sounded like until after the tournament, leading to this hillarious screenshot:

skwareman was not very happy that he got L'ed. so much aboos, skwareman purge so much, anchovy not happy. very not happy. then sdash took screenshots and posted them in random. and then skwareman purge again. anchovy not happy.

## christmas

i got a kindle and some raycons. (insert raycon youtube sponsorship ad here) they're actually really good (not an ad). they're so tiny and yet are noise cancelling.

anyways kindle also very cool. i'm reading 1984. why 1984? because that was the first book loaded onto the kindle.

## i hope i'm ont forgetting anything

cuz then i'll have to update this.

## alright bye
