# merry holidays

oops i forgot about this

if you're reading this, hi

## actual content

happy holidays, whatever you celebrate - christmas, hanukkuh, kwanzaa, anchovy day, boxing day, anchovy day (1), or any other holiday

stay safe, and have fun!

also it snowed today. then it melted. but hey, at least we got snow in 2022. very epik.

today we had a fid (flexible instruction day). its also the day before winter break and now everyone who left yesterday has work. kinda an L bozo moment if you ask me.

still don't know how to write blog posts.

## ABSOLUTE GAMOR

started playing gdash

skipped all the easy ones because I'M NOT A PUSSY and went straight to clutterfunk. got 13% first try. very epik gamor.

i've been playing some val. i suck and i get carried by my friends.

one of my friends who has a friend who's immortal 1. we played with him today. got carried.

## disney.

oh and i got back from disney. that was fun.

a bunch of ppl cried because it was the official end of the marching band season. i play clarinet. clarinet is gud.

we flew on spirit. ðŸ’€

i had lots of fun, but nothing was scary. everest was fun tho.

on the return trip i sat a sports bar. 13 years old and i already sat a bar. yeah, i'm 13 now. no longer breaking discord tos. my birthday was the 9th.

argentina w moment.

## math stuff

i didn't qualify for aime, thank you for asking

idk what happened, i got a 72

i choked on really ez problems.

the thing that pisses me the off most is that there's the kid

thinks he's good at math. he got a 76.5 by guessing.

this kid thought he'd qualify for aime. absolute bozo.

i should've actually prepared. should've signed up for b.

oh well, who cares, this season's gone, time to prepare for next year. also i got first for mc in school. very epik.

also, i will be at cmimc 2023! i can't believe this is happening! i was invited to a math competition! i will be with spectator, rft, megarnie, streak, plang2008, and another dude who doesn't want his information dropped

time to get carried

## computer

i got a new computer that's not a chromebook. on the first day i broke it by trying to change the user folder name. that was very kool and epik of me ngl. so now my folder in users is realname.REALNAME

so that was fun.

i'm learning go. i have some background in javascript and c# (i'm not good trust me), so it's pretty ez.

also i made this.

## typing boi

i've been hopping on typemonkey during class. i average ~120. pb is 147.

the main thing holding me back is that my fingies are always so tired because english teacher makes us write out everything and everyday we have to write like a paragraph as a "warmup"

english sux.
